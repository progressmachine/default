Alright, here’s a super simple explanation of APIs in Python — no tech jargon, no fluff. Just straight-up basics.

⸻

🔧 What’s an API?

API = a waiter in a restaurant.
You ask the waiter for food. The waiter goes to the kitchen and brings you back your dish.

In programming, the kitchen = some server somewhere (like Google, weather app, etc).
The API = the waiter that goes and brings back info.

🐍 Using APIs in Python

Let’s say we want to ask a weather website what the weather is like in your city.

We’ll use a simple GET request. That’s like saying:
“Hey, give me the weather info.”

You can do this using a Python library called requests.

⸻

💡 Example Code (Super Simple)

import requests

# This is a fake example URL of a weather API
url = "https://api.weatherapi.com/v1/current.json"
params = {
    "key": "your_api_key",  # You get this when you sign up
    "q": "Kathmandu",       # City name
}

response = requests.get(url, params=params)  # Ask the API for info

data = response.json()  # Convert the response to Python dict

# Now let's print something from that data
print("Temperature:", data["current"]["temp_c"], "°C")

💭 What Just Happened?
	1.	You used requests.get() to ask for data.
	2.	You gave it a URL (like a phone number to call).
	3.	The API answered.
	4.	You turned that answer into a Python dictionary using .json().
	5.	You picked the info you wanted from it.

🔑 Notes
	•	Most APIs need a key — like a password.
	•	You can find free APIs online (e.g., weather, jokes, Pokémon, etc.).
	•	Always read the API’s documentation like you’d read a menu.
