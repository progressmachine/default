You’re not biting off more than you can chew — you just need a clear, phased plan. Here’s one way to break it down into manageable steps:

---

## 🚀 Phase 1 – CLI Flashcards & Anki Export

1. **Flashcard Storage**
   – Keep your cards in a simple JSON file:

   ```json
   [
     { "front": "Guten Morgen", "back": "Good morning" },
     { "front": "Ich lerne Python", "back": "I’m learning Python" }
   ]
   ```
2. **Review Loop**
   – A Python CLI that reads your JSON deck, quizzes you, and records right/wrong.
3. **Export to `.apkg`**
   – Use the [`genanki`](https://github.com/kerrickstaley/genanki) library to package your JSON into an Anki deck file.
   – You’ll end up with `my_deck.apkg` that you can import into AnkiDesktop or AnkiMobile.

## 🎨 Phase 2 – Simple Web Interface

1. **Flask (or FastAPI) Backend**
   – Endpoints to add/edit/delete cards (persist to JSON or a tiny SQLite DB).
   – Endpoint to “Download Anki Deck” that streams your generated `.apkg`.
2. **Vanilla JS Frontend**
   – A clean, minimal UI to manage cards right in the browser.
3. **PWA Wrapping**
   – Make it installable on iPhone as a Progressive Web App (add to Home Screen).

---

## 📱 Phase 3 – Native iOS App (Optional)

If you want to go fully native down the road:

1. **BeeWare/Briefcase** or **Kivy-ios**
   – Tools that let you package Python apps for iOS.
2. **SwiftUI + PythonKit**
   – Or learn a bit of Swift and call your Python logic via PythonKit.
3. **App Store Deployment**
   – Certificates, provisioning profiles, etc.

### 🔥 Next Step

Which part sounds most exciting?

* **CLI + Anki export** (Phase 1 MVP)
* **Web-based PWA** (Phase 2)
* **Jump straight to native iOS** (Phase 3)
